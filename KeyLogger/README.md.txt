# KeyLogger

### Description
Simple script that prints all keyboard inputs to a text file for future reference. This file was made for ethical purposes and to test various Python capabilities. 

Example:
> Store keystrokes while working on a project or for backup notes. Personally, I run this while I have multiple tabs that I am working across, so if I incorrectly enter something in the wrong tab, I can go to the log and copy and paste into the appropriate place.

### Features
- Stores keystroke history locally.
- Does not manipulate input or text.
